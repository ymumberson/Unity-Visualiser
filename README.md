# Unity-Visualiser
Just playing around with visualising stuff in Unity, inspired by and following a video by Sebastian Lague where he showcases his visualisation tools along with a small bit of code.

The aim of this project is to gain an understanding of animating some visualisations in unity, without just spawning a million game objects and causing a lot of garbage :)

You can find Sebastian's video at https://youtu.be/kIMHRQWorkE
